## About Unclutter

Unclutter is a uniquely designed productivity application that creates a concealed storage and utility space right at the edge of your screen. Activated by a simple gesture (like dragging down from the menu bar), it slides open a sleek panel divided into three essential sections: Files, Notes, and Clipboard. This design solves the common struggle of balancing quick access to temporary items with the desire for a clean, organized desktop. Instead of scattering files everywhere or losing track of copied information, you have a dedicated, always-ready space that stays out of sight until you need it.

The brilliance of Unclutter lies in its simplicity and seamless integration into your workflow. The Files area acts like a temporary shelf for items you're actively using. The Notes section is a distraction-free space for quick thoughts or code snippets. The Clipboard history is a game-changer, ensuring you never lose a copied piece of information again. By consolidating these three universally useful tools into a single, gesture-activated panel, Unclutter removes friction from common tasks, saving you time and helping maintain a focused digital workspace.
